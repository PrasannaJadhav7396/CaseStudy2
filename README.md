# CaseStudy2

You have been asked to set up a Blue/Green (B/G) solution for a mission-critical web application running on AWS. It should consist of two separate environments. The blue environment contains Amazon EC2 instances in an Auto Scaling group that runs the current production version of the application. The green environment contains EC2 instances in another Auto Scaling group that runs the new version of the application. Each Auto Scaling group is behind its own Application Load Balancer (ALB), so you can configure two alias records as endpoints in Amazon Route 53 and use a routing policy to gradually shift traffic from the ALB for the blue environment to the ALB for the green environment. Route 53 endpoint must be accessible from the internet through a domain name and HTTPS protocol only. Setup this combination to achieve B/G deployment and explain how different backend database endpoints will be handled in this situation
